temp-font-installer
===================

Temporary install fonts in Windows. Targeting Windows Vista+ at first.

Designed for workstations where you don't have administrative rights to
install fonts.  The application will maintain a list of fonts, as well
as the files for those fonts.  It will also automatically create a startup
item, so the fonts get installed immediately when you log in, ever time.
